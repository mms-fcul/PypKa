Pypka
=================================

A python module for flexible Poisson-Boltzmann based p\ :emphasis:`K`\
:sub:`a` calculations.

We have implemented a flexible tool to predict Poisson-Boltzmann-based
p\ :emphasis:`K`\ :sub:`a` values of biomolecules. This is a free and
open source project that provides a simple, reusable and extensible
python API and CLI for p\ :emphasis:`K`\ :sub:`a` calculations with a
valuable trade-off between fast and accurate predictions. With PypKa
one can enable p\ :emphasis:`K`\ :sub:`a` calculations, including
optional proton tautomerism, within existing protocols by adding a few
extra lines of code. PypKa supports CPU parallel computing on
anisotropic (membrane) and isotropic (protein) systems and allows the
user to find a balance between accuracy and speed.

PypKa is written in Python and Cython and it is integrated with the
Poisson-Boltzmann solver DelPhi Fortran77.
